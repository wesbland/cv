Dr. Jack Dongarra (dongarra@eecs.utk.edu), Dr. George Bosilca
(bosilca@eecs.utk.edu) \hfill August 2009 -- April 2013 
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % Reduce space between items
        \item Developed User Level Failure Mitigation (ULFM), a proposal to
            the MPI forum discussing fault tolerance in MPI, and the
            accompanying implemenation based on Open MPI.
        \item Developed Checkpoint-on-Failure (CoF), a fault tolerant protocol
            using MPI-3 techniques to checkpoint applications after a failure
            rather than periodically throughout the application lifecycle.
        \item Worked with various libraries and applications to help
            implement fault tolerance using ULFM.
