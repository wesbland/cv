{\sl Senior Software Engineer, Intel Corporation, Champaign, IL -- Austin, TX} \\
Dr. Maria Garzaran (maria.garzaran@intel.com), Craig Belusar (craig.belusar@intel.com)
\hfill March 2015 -- Present
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
        \item Leading development effort for next generation MPI implementation
            for Intel OmniPath on the Aurora supercomputer using libfabric as
            the basic communication layer.
        \item Redesigned MPICH code base to rely on libfabric for more efficient
            infrastructure using scalable endpoints, address vectors, data
            fields, etc.
        \item Provide feedback and testing for libfabric team to prioritize
            implementation of future Intel fabric providers.
        \item Helped start up new developement and NRE team including
            familiaring team with MPICH codebase, setting up code testing and
            management infrastructure, and interactions with other Intel teams
            (fabric, Intel MPI, threading, etc.).

Dr. Jack Dongarra (dongarra@eecs.utk.edu), Dr. George Bosilca
(bosilca@eecs.utk.edu) \hfill August 2009 -- April 2013 
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt % Reduce space between items
        \item Developed User Level Failure Mitigation (ULFM), a proposal to
            the MPI forum discussing fault tolerance in MPI, and the
            accompanying implemenation based on Open MPI.
        \item Developed Checkpoint-on-Failure (CoF), a fault tolerant protocol
            using MPI-3 techniques to checkpoint applications after a failure
            rather than periodically throughout the application lifecycle.
        \item Worked with various libraries and applications to help
            implement fault tolerance using ULFM.
